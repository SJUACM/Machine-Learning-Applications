View this repository in VS Code by clicking [here](https://github1s.com/SJUSATA/Machine-Learning-Applications)

## To Launch all Python Notebook files (.ipynb):
  
  - Click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SJUSATA/Machine-Learning-Applications/tree/main/)
  
  - Choose a project and open a file 
  
  - You can now look through the code!

  - To interact with and run the code, click on the 'Execute on Binder' button on the top right of the screen. (This will take a considerable amount of time to load)

  - Once loaded, you can download the file to save your changes
  
  - You can also download the .ipynb files in this repository and upload them in Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)

  - Alternatively, if you want to run .ipynb files on your local machine, you can download jupyter notebook by running `pip install notebook` and then running `jupyter notebook`. Read more [here](https://jupyter.org/install)
  
## To Run the Python files (.py):

  - Download the code `git clone https://github.com/SJUSATA/Machine-Learning-Applications.git`

  - Navigate to the directory `cd Machine-Learning-Applications`

  - Follow the instructions in your specific project's folder
